E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis


“In this project, I created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze an e-commerce company’s sales performance across dimensions like category, region, customer segment, and shipping type. I used DAX to calculate YoY changes and KPIs like profit margin and sales trends. The dashboard enables users to quickly identify key products, underperforming regions, and logistical bottlenecks. This project helped me apply advanced Power BI features such as drill-through, segment toggles, interactive visuals, and efficient data modeling.”

Objective:

The main goal of this project was to create a fully dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze e-commerce sales performance across multiple business dimensions like time, product categories, regions, customer segments, and shipping methods. The dashboard helps in deriving actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
